# Porting Plethora to Avalanche

1. dashboard : no need, only need cli app
2. engine : port entirely to ethereum, keep logic same
3. go-cli : keep same, make it compatible with the updated engine
4. solana-stress-forge : will stay the same, just the website showing analytics
5. x402-test : port to avalanche fuji testnet, just the sample x402 website which we will use to stress test
